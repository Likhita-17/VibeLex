This project is an AI-powered English learning and current-affairs assistant focused on helping users understand real-world vocabulary and terminology used in modern news and industries.

It takes news articles as input, applies topic modeling and semantic understanding using transformer-based language models, identifies complex or domain-specific terms, and explains them in simple language with examples and short stories.

The system also builds a dynamic “Vibe Dictionary” where users can search words (e.g., bull in finance) and receive context-aware explanations, usage examples, and quizzes to reinforce learning.

The goal is to combine LLMs, NLP, and real-time news to improve English proficiency, vocabulary, and awareness of current global topics in a single platform.
